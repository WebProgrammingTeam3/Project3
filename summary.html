    <p> Option two of the Project assignment wasn't our first choice. We actually started with option 1, the puzzle problem. We started as a 3x3 board to make it a little ear to start out and add as a bonus to game when we do the 15 piece puzzle.
        We were able to create and design a border for the section of images and create a shuffle button that shuffled the images at random. We were unfortunately unable to figure out how to move the images around and so
        we all decided as a group to try option 2, which is Conway's game of life, which seemed to be an easier task than the puzzle, hence why we stuck with option 2. </p>
    <p> Not that we didn't choose it because it was easier, we also chose option 2 because most of us in the group has never heard of the game, so making the game would help provide new insights on a unfamiliar project
        Even though option 2 was an easier task than option 1, Conways game of life still proved to be a challenge. Some of the difficulties we faced was getting some of the buttons to work such as the start button, end button,
        and the reset button. We used outside resources to help create the board and have some of the game mechanics to work which helped us a lot in the creation process. </p>
